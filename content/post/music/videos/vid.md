These are some of my favorite music videos!

## Knights of Cydonia:

This video is a really cool mix between a 1970's Italian Western movie and a sci-fi film!

## Breaking the Law:

This  video feels more like a classic heist film, it's very cool!

## Limelight:

I like this video because it feels more like you're watching a live concert.
