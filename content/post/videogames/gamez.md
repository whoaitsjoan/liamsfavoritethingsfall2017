Destiny 2:
The weapons are the best! Riskrunner is my favorite exotic weapon, it does chain lightning damage. 
I love roaming around the different planets!

Mario Kart 8:
Best powerups! The Blue Shell is my favorite powerup. I can play with Mii characters, they're my favorite racers.

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare:
My favorite weapons are the RPR-Evo, MV4, Volk, VPR, Mauler, Titan, KBS Longbow. So many cool weapons! 
I also really the Zombies mode for the Pack-a-Punch . It takes some work, but it's very worth it. 


Titanfall 2:
I like this more than the first Titanfall, there's a lot of better Titans. The story is also a lot more interesting
than the first game. Great damage, all the weapons feel really powerful.

Rock Band 4: 
The songs were great, my favorite songs in a Rock Band game so far! I especially like Tom Sawyer by Rush. 
I love watching Rock Band videos when I have free time. My favorite instrument to play is the guitar.
