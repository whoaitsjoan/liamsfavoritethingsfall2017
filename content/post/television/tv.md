King of the Hill: 
The animation is really good in this one. The characters are really good, too. Bobby Hill is probably my favorite,
he's really funny!

South Park:
It's a really funny show! A very crude show, but that's why it's really good.

Family Ties:
Now this is a classic sitcom, straight out of the 80's. Michael J. Fox is really good in this show. 
I really like the family dynamic on this show, it makes it more interesting for me than other sitcoms.

Reboot:
This early computer animation is really cool. I think it still holds up today. And sci-fi is always fun!

That 70's Show:
It's a great show that takes in the 1970's, from 1976 to 1979. A great 90's sitcom.
