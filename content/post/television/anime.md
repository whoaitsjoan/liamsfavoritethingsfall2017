I also really like Japanese animation, or anime, and these are some of my favorites!

## Hyperdimension Neptunia

I like it because it's really funny and the animation is brilliant!

## Robotech

This is a very retro anime, it came out all the way back in 1985. 
It's kinda like Japanese Star Wars, like a big space opera!

## Jojo's Bizzare Adventure

This anime has a lot of good music in it.

## Cowboy Bepop

It's like a space western, and the intro is kinda like an old spy movie.
