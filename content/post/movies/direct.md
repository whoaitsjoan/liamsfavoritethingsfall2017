I want to be a director when I grow up, specifically making trailers!

In my free time, I make movie trailers using a bunch of different clips. I have been
making trailers for over a year using Sony Movie Studio after my dad gave it to me. 
Most of them are horror movie trailers, and it's a lot of fun. 

And it's really easy too, it only takes me about five minutes once I have all the clips I'm looking for.

This is a recut trailer for Stephen King's Riding the Bullet, 
using a bunch of different movie clips from the 60's and 70's. 
I chose because it shows a lot of people screaming at the same time.
That trailer is already really funny, and that's why I decided to make clips for it.
