I really like movies, but I especially like movie trailers. Here are some of my favorites!

## The Fifth Element
The music score by Eric Serra is very good, the special effects are amazing, even today. 
Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are both really amazing too.

## Spider Man: Homecoming

It's a really funny superhero movie. It doesn't feel like a regular superhero movie either, more like an old John Hughes film.
Spider-Man is a really great superhero too, probably my favorite superhero.

## Star Wars: A New Hope

It is the classic 70's space opera movie. This movie is my favorite of the original trilogy, followed by Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
The Force Awakens is up there after that. The music by John Williams is really epic, and is so iconic too.

##Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back

This is my favorite Star Wars of the original trilogy! 
My favorite scene is on the bridge in Cloud City when Darth Vader reveals that he is Luke's father.

## Blade Runner 2049

It's a very futuristic film. The running time is a lot longer than the original, although I haven't seen the original yet.

## Guardians of the Galaxy

The soundtrack is very awesome, very 70's. Chris Pratt has a very good performance in this movie.
It's a very good superhero sci-fi movie!
