My name is Liam, I&rsquo;m 17 years old, and this is my website!
I live in Queens with my mom and dad, I go to school and my favorite subjects there are math and reading.
When I&rsquo;m not in school, I&rsquo;m watching a lot of movies, playing a lot of video games, and listen to a lot of prog rock.
My website talks about all the different things that I like, I hope you enjoy it!</p>

											<p>King of the Hill: The animation is really good in this one. The characters are really good, too. Bobby Hill is probably my favorite, he&rsquo;s really funny! South Park: It&rsquo;s a really funny show! A very crude show, but that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really good. Family Ties: Now this is a classic sitcom, straight out of the 80&rsquo;s. Michael J. Fox is really good in this show. I really like the family dynamic on this show, it makes it more interesting for me than other sitcoms.</p>

											<p>Destiny 2: The weapons are the best! Riskrunner is my favorite exotic weapon, it does chain lightning damage. I love roaming around the different planets! Mario Kart 8: Best powerups! The Blue Shell is my favorite powerup. I can play with Mii characters, they&rsquo;re my favorite racers. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare: My favorite weapons are the RPR-Evo, MV4, Volk, VPR, Mauler, Titan, KBS Longbow. So many cool weapons! I also really the Zombies mode for the Pack-a-Punch .</p>

											<p>I want to be a director when I grow up, specifically making trailers!
In my free time, I make movie trailers using a bunch of different clips. I have been making trailers for over a year using Sony Movie Studio after my dad gave it to me. Most of them are horror movie trailers, and it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.
And it&rsquo;s really easy too, it only takes me about five minutes once I have all the clips I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>

											<p>I also really like Japanese animation, or anime, and these are some of my favorites!
Hyperdimension Neptunia I like it because it&rsquo;s really funny and the animation is brilliant!
  Robotech This is a very retro anime, it came out all the way back in 1985. It&rsquo;s kinda like Japanese Star Wars, like a big space opera!
  Jojo&rsquo;s Bizzare Adventure This anime has a lot of good music in it.</p>

											<p>Prog rock: I really like King Crimson, Rush, Pink Floyd Classic rock: Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Judas Preist
Vinyl: I like having records to play at home, and to collect the music I like. I feel like it really does sound better! </p>

											<p> These are some of my favorite music videos!
Knights of Cydonia: This video is a really cool mix between a 1970&rsquo;s Italian Western movie and a sci-fi film!
  Breaking the Law: This video feels more like a classic heist film, it&rsquo;s very cool!
  Tom Sawyer:   Limelight: I like this video because it feels more like you&rsquo;re watching a live concert.

											<p>I really like movies, but I especially like movie trailers. Here are some of my favorites!
The Fifth Element The music score by Eric Serra is very good, the special effects are amazing, even today. Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are both really amazing too.
  Spider Man: Homecoming It&rsquo;s a really funny superhero movie. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like a regular superhero movie either, more like an old John Hughes film.</p>
